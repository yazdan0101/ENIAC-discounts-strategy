# ENIAC Discounts Strategy

Welcome to **ENIAC Discounts Strategy**,  
This project aims to analyze the impact of product discounts using internal (non-anonymized) data, with a focus on answering a central business question:  

> _Are product discounts beneficial for the company in the long run?_

---

## üß† Project Background

Eniac‚Äôs leadership is divided:

- **The Marketing Team Lead** strongly believes discounts are a growth tool ‚Äî helping with customer **acquisition**, **satisfaction**, and **retention**.
- **The Board of Investors**, on the other hand, is concerned about recent trends: **more orders but less revenue**. They favor a focus on **quality** over price competition.

You‚Äôve been tasked with using Python to uncover insights and settle this debate.
